1.  Test to see if code will output a "1" for a one letter lowercase input and a matching comparison input. $wordToCount = 'i'; $sentence = 'i';


2.  Test to see if code will output a "1" for a one letter uppercase input and a matching comparison input. $wordToCount = 'I'; $sentence = 'I';


3.  Test to see if code will output a "1" for a two letter, all lowercase input and a matching comparison input. $wordToCount = 'in'; $sentence = 'in';


4.  Test to see if code will output a "1" for a two letter, all uppercase input and a matching comparison input. $wordToCount = 'IN'; $sentence = 'IN';

5.  Test to see if code will output a "1" for a two letter input with both upper and lowercase letter, and a matching comparison input. $wordToCount = 'In'; $sentence = 'In';

6.  Test to see if code will output a "2" when both words of the comparison input match. Example: wordToCount = 'It'; $sentence = 'It It';

7.  Test to see if code will output a "1" when only one word matches a two word comparison input. Example:  $wordToCount = 'It'; $sentence = 'It is';

8.  Test to see if code will output a "2" if the comparison input match contains 2 matches and other words. Example: wordToCount = 'It'; $sentence = 'It is so funny that It hurts';

9.  Test to see if code will output a "3" if the comparison input match contains 3 matches that have different case configurations, and other words. Example: wordToCount = 'That'; $sentence = 'That is great tHAt is funny that is cool THAT is dumb thAT rules';

10. Test to see if code will output "0" if there are not any matches.
