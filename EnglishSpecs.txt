1.  Test to see if code will output a "1" for a one letter lowercase input and a matching comparison input. $wordToCount = 'i'; $sentence = 'i';
This the simplest way to test the behavior because it is only one letter in one case.


2.  Test to see if code will output a "1" for a one letter uppercase input and a matching comparison input. $wordToCount = 'I'; $sentence = 'I';
This the simplest way to test the behavior because it is only one letter in one case.

3.  Test to see if code will output a "1" for a two letter, all lowercase input and a matching comparison input. $wordToCount = 'in'; $sentence = 'in';
This the simplest way to test the behavior because it is only one word, with 2 letters in one case.

4.  Test to see if code will output a "1" for a two letter, all uppercase input and a matching comparison input. $wordToCount = 'IN'; $sentence = 'IN';
This the simplest way to test the behavior because it is only one word, with 2 letters in one case.

5.  Test to see if code will output a "1" for a two letter input with both upper and lowercase letter, and a matching comparison input. $wordToCount = 'In'; $sentence = 'In';
This the simplest way to test the behavior because it is only one word, with 2 letters, mixed case, written the same.

6.  Test to see if code will output a "2" when both words of the comparison input match. Example: wordToCount = 'It'; $sentence = 'It It';
This the simplest way to test the behavior because it is only two words, with 2 letters, mixed case, written the same.

7.  Test to see if code will output a "1" when only one word matches a two word comparison input. Example:  $wordToCount = 'It'; $sentence = 'It is';
This the simplest way to test the behavior because it is only two words, with only one match.

8.  Test to see if code will output a "2" if the comparison input match contains 2 matches and other words. Example: wordToCount = 'It'; $sentence = 'It is It';
This the simplest way to test the behavior because the sentence has only three words with two matches written exactly the same.

9. Test to see if code will output a "2" if the comparison input match contains 2 matches that have different case configurations, and other words. Example: wordToCount = 'It'; $sentence = It is it;
This the simplest way to test the behavior because the sentence has only three matches in three different case configurations.

10.  Test to see if code will output a "3" if the comparison input match contains 3 matches that have different case configurations, and other words. Example: wordToCount = 'That'; $sentence = 'That is great tHAt is funny that is cool THAT is dumb thAT rules'; 
This the simplest way to test the behavior because the sentence has only three matches in three different case configurations.

11. Test to see if code will output "0" if there are not any matches.
